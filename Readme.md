# Impulse: An Automated Bot to Take Pulse Surveys

## Setup process

**Selenium installation**: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

**Short Survey-Automation Blog Post I Used a Lil**: http://devinmancuso.com/blog/2015/using-selenium-to-mess-with-survey-monkey.html

**Automating the Web with Selenium (blog post)**: https://irwinkwan.com/2013/04/05/automating-the-web-with-selenium-complete-tasks-automatically-and-write-test-cases/

## Stats
These are underestimates, as I started running the bot before I set up the stats-tracking and saving part. 

**Total Pulse points accumulated (2 different accounts)**: 17160
**Total Pulse surveys taken**: 1421 
**Shortest time taken on a single survey**: 10 seconds (expected time 50 seconds)
